A URL shortener.

The service run as an HTTP server. I want the service to be accessible only via
nginx, so I bind only 127.0.0.1. Cookie reading and writing is only done in SSL
mode. Login is only available in SSL mode.

The code should be reviewed (especially w.r.t. SSL/Cookies/Login/Password
stuffs). There are a lot of TODOs.

The code is probably too specific for general use (which is the goal of this
package).

I hope to make the code readable for Haskell noobs as I think a URL shortener
is a nice little project for beginners.
